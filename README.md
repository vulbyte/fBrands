# fBrands

an addon i made for the twitterDotCom. the point of this is to hide brands who paid for the verified (yellow) checkmark, as their tweets are often annoying and ruin the platform to anyone who doesn't consider ketchup and chocolate a good combination.

## how to install

this plugin was made with firefox, no idea how to do so on chrome.

1. download the plugin. cd into your ideal containing folder, then `git clone https://github.com/vulbyte/fBrands`
1. go to: (about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)[about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox]
1. click: "load temporary add-on"
1. select any file within the addon folder EXCEPT THE TEST FOLDER. doing so will result in an error
1. it should now be running
1. if you're having issues, check the console
1. if you find an issue, report it (here: https://github.com/vulbyte/fBrands/issues)[https://github.com/vulbyte/fBrands/issues]
