# NOTE: THIS PLUGIN IS UNSTABLE AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE TWITTER CRASH

# fBrands

an addon i made for the twitterDotCom. the point of this is to hide brands who paid for the verified (yellow) checkmark, as their tweets are often annoying and ruin the platform to anyone who doesn't consider ketchup and chocolate a good combination.

## how to install

this plugin was made with firefox, no idea how to do so on chrome.

1. download the plugin. cd into your ideal containing folder, then `git clone https://github.com/vulbyte/fBrands`
1. go to: (about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)[about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox]
1. click: "load temporary add-on"
1. select any file within the addon folder EXCEPT THE TEST FOLDER. doing so will result in an error
1. it should now be running
1. if you're having issues, check the console
1. if you find an issue, report it (here: https://github.com/vulbyte/fBrands/issues)[https://github.com/vulbyte/fBrands/issues]

current todo list:

- [ ] add local storage saving for settings/config
- [ ] fix crashing
- [ ] make the addon only run after a scroll
- [ ] make it so the tweet is actually in the collapsed thing
- [ ] add styling so it looks less garbo
- [ ] html ez config to adjust things like timing and the like

## other things i'm considering:

likely:

- [ ] flag for blue checkmarks (paid verified)
- [ ] flag for gray checkmarks (officials)

semi-likely:

- [ ] chrome version
- [ ] toggle to "bring back old twitter" (replace logos)
- [ ] make square brand icons circlular
- [ ] hide twitter blue "spaces" due to the pop-up being annoying and messing with timeline
- [ ] "minimalize twitter" (hide grok, lists, communities, premium, && community notes)

unlikely:

- [ ] ad hiding feature
- [ ] custom theme for twitter
